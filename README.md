# ChiptuneMaker
Chiptune Maker is a single-page application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It lets you upload any audio file in the browser, apply a retro “chiptune” style bit-crush and sample-rate conversion, preview the result in real time, and download the processed track as a WAV file.
This service is written in the following languages:

## Features
- Audio Upload: Drag & drop or select WAV/MP3 files directly in the browser.
- Bit Depth Control: Choose bit depths between 1 and 16 bits for classic quantization noise.
- Sample Rate Adjustment: Set target rates from 1,000 to 44,100 Hz to introduce aliasing artifacts.
- Real‑Time Preview: Hear changes instantly as you tweak parameters.
- Progress Indicator: A progress bar shows conversion status for larger file.
- Custom Filename: Specify a custom filename before downloading your chiptune.
